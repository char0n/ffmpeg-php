# FFmpegPHP

FFmpegPHP is a pure OO [PSR-4 compatible](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) PHP port of [ffmpeg-php](http://ffmpeg-php.sourceforge.net/) library (that was written in C). It adds an easy to use,
object-oriented API for accessing and retrieving information from video and audio files.
It has methods for returning frames from movie files as images that can be manipulated
using PHP image functions. This works well for automatically creating thumbnail images from movies.
FFmpegPHP is also useful for reporting the duration and bitrate of audio files (mp3, wma...).
FFmpegPHP can access many of the video formats supported by ffmpeg (mov, avi, mpg, wmv...)

## Drop-in replacement for ffmpeg-php

FFmpegPHP can be used as a drop in replacement for [ffmpeg-php](http://ffmpeg-php.sourceforge.net/) library.


## Documentation

FFmpegPHP API documentation can be found here http://char0n.github.io/ffmpeg-php/.

## Requirements

- PHP >=7
- PHP extensions: gd, mbstring, xml
- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) or ffprobe



## Installation

### Source code

Grab the source code located in `src/` directory and use it as you seem appropriate.


### Composer installation

Grab the `composer.phar` which can install packages published on [packagist](https://packagist.org/).

```bash
 $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/composer/getcomposer.org/1b137f8bf6db3e79a38a5bc45324414a6b1f9df2/web/installer -O - -q | php
```

This command will create file called `composer.phar`.

Create a file called `composer.json` and paste the following JSON into it:

```json
 {
    "require": {
        "char0n/ffmpeg-php": "^3.0.0"
    }
 }
```

Install the FFmpegPHP by running the following command:

```bash
$ php composer.phar install
```

After this command is successfully executed, the new directory called `vendor/` is created.
File structure of your current working directory should now look like this:

```
 - composer.json
 - composer.phar
 - vendor/
```

To verify that everything works as expected create new file called `test.php` inside your current working
directory with the following content.

```php
<?php
require_once './vendor/autoload.php';

use Char0n\FFMpegPHP\Movie;

$movie = new Movie('./test.mp4');
var_dump($movie->getDuration());
```

Before you run the script you need to also download the testing movie file:

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/char0n/ffmpeg-php/raw/master/tests/data/test.mp4
```

Now run it.

```bash
$ php test.php
```

The output should be something similar to the following:
```
float(32.14)
```


**Note**

Notice the first line (`require './vendor/autoload.php';`) in the above script. This line is
necessary because it configures how the FFmpegPHP will be included into your scripts and it
auto-magically knows where to look for FFmpegPHP.


# Using FFmpegPHP

## Object Oriented interface

FFmpegPHP is build using PSR-4 standard and it's interface is purely Object Oriented. We're using standar
OOP patterns to create our API.

```php
use Char0n\FFMpegPHP\Movie;

$movie = new Movie('/path/to/media.mpeg');
$movie->getDuration(); // => 24
```


## Compatibility layer

On top of our OO interface, there is an additional one that provides full compatibility with original [ffmpeg-php](http://ffmpeg-php.sourceforge.net/) library.

```php
use Char0n\FFMpegPHP\Adapters\FFMpegMovie as ffmpeg_movie;

$movie = new ffmpeg_movie('/path/to/media.mpeg');
$movie->getDuration(); // => 24
```

## Partnership with GoDaddy

[GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) started to use FFmpegPHP as part of it's services
from November 2018. If you need a server with [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
and [FFmpegPHP](https://github.com/char0n/ffmpeg-php) installed on it
contact GoDaddy and they'll do it for you as part of its "Expert Service".
As author of FFmpegPHP I agreed to provide support for users coming
from GoDaddy asking about FFmpegPHP. All incoming GoDaddy customers,
please use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/char0n/ffmpeg-php/issues/new)
as a support channel.
